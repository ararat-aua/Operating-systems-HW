Program output:

	Size of int variale: 4
	Adress of int variable: 0x7ffdf4e9187c

	Size of char variale: 1
	Adress of char variable: 0x7ffdf4e91879

	Size of double variale: 8
	Adress of double variable: 0x7ffdf4e91880

	Size of short variale: 2
	Adress of short variable: 0x7ffdf4e9187a


Explanation:
	An auxiliary python code is written to sort the adresses by their ascending order
	Original dict:
  		int: 0x7ffdf4e9187c
  		char: 0x7ffdf4e91879
  		double: 0x7ffdf4e91880
  		short: 0x7ffdf4e9187a

	Sorted (ascending by value):
  		char: 0x7ffdf4e91879
  		short: 0x7ffdf4e9187a
  		int: 0x7ffdf4e9187c
  		double: 0x7ffdf4e91880
	
	and the offset between them:
	[1, 2, 4]
	
	As can be noticed the variables are aligned in memory in order of ascending of their
	type ascending. The offsets between any two is equal to the sieze of the first so no padding
	is added.
