As we can see in output, the change of order affects the struct size.
As the struct is aligned due to its largest element size, in first case we have
char with padding 4, then int with padding 0, then double with padding 0.
Totally we have 1+3+4+8=16

In second case we have char with padding 7, double with padding 0, int with padding 4
Totally we have 1+7+8+4+4=24
